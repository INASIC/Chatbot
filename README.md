This project was heavily inspired by the series of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOnYLDg8_Y&t=20s) by [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ). 

In my iPython [notebook](https://github.com/INASIC/Chatbot/blob/master/Chatbot%20Documentation.ipynb), I present comprehensive documentation of my experience with this series, which involved creating a chatbot with deep learning, Python and TensorFlow.
