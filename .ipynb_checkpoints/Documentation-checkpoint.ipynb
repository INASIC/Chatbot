    "# Introduction & Collecting our Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used here in building this chatbot is designed to be generalizable for building chatbots that can be used for a diverse range of applications. A large differentiating factor between the different implementations of chatbots, will largely depend on the type of training data used to build the chatbot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with all machine learning applications, one of the biggest obstacles is to collect the relevant data, and manipulate it to be useful for a given task. One of the most common data sets that people tend to use for building (relatively weak) chatbots is the open-source [Cornell movie database](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html), which contains 220,000 conversational exchanges between 10,300 pairs of movie characters. In addition to it being open-source, it contains conversational data from different movies, different characters, and different genders, which allows for a dataset that is fairly balanced to train on. However, a major draw-back is that there is a fairly limited amount of conversational exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the era of deep learning, big data is really the fuel for our machine learning applications. As we are building a chatbot that utilizes deep learning, our model will necessarily be very data hungry. Therefore, the Cornell movie database discussed will be fairly limited in its size. In search of a larger corpus of conversational exchanges to train our chatbot, we thus turn to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), a popular collection of online forums where people share news, stories, and other types of content, and users are encouraged to comment and discuss about everyones posts. The popularity of Reddit is immense. It was measured that almost 1.69 billion users had accessed the site in just the month of March 2018, alone ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/443332/reddit-monthly-visitors/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "To extract this conversational data from Reddit, we could have used the [Python Reddit API](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but it has some pretty strict limitations. This API unfortunately will not allow you to parse millions of rows without a longer period of time, or violating the Terms of Service. Instead we can use a Reddit post that provides a [data dump of 1.7 Billion Reddit Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/?st=j9udbxta&sh=69e4fee7). This datafile is about 250 GB of data, when compressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will compare the performance of the chatbot on different sizes, and receny of reddit comment data which will be as follows:\n",
    "1. A __small__ dataset of __1.4 GB__ collected from an __older__ time: __January 2012__\n",
    "2. A __medium__ sized dataset of __9.1 GB__ collected from a more __recent__ time, __June 2018__\n",
    "3. A __large__ dataset of ~ __250 GB__, from between __December 2005 to June 2018__\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was collected from this [website](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/), where the datafiles are available in compressed form - allowing for relatively fast download speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "If you observe the following [sample Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/?sort=top) and scroll down to the comments, you can observe that the comments are arranged in a __tree-like structure__, where you have parent comments at the top, followed by child comments which are in response to the parent above it. What we will need to do is to pull these strings of comments apart, and then  pair them together in a parent-child (comment and reply) manner. This allows us to capture natural conversational exchanges between humans on the internet, which we can then provide as training data to our chatbot to mimic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we begin by __building our database__ that will store our parent comments that are paired to their best child (reply) comments. The reason do this is because a lot of these files are way too big for us to read into RAM and create training files from. For now, to keep things relatively simple we will use __SQLite__ for our database. \n",
    "\n",
    "The datafiles we are using are stored in the __JSON__ format. Because of this, there is a lot of unnecessary data within each of the files. When building our database, we will extract the following data from our JSON files:\n",
    "* Comment score (karma)\n",
    "* The comment body itself\n",
    "* Subreddit\n",
    "* The parent_id\n",
    "* Time of creation (UTC)\n",
    "\n",

However, the value 2 is somewhat arbitrary, and is a threshold parameter which can be changed for different applications. For example if we are dealing with a much larger dataset, with many more comments - then it may be helpful to set this threshold to be higher - for example ```score >= 15```.
